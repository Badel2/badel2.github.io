title: Writing a digital logic simulator - Part 1
---

This is the first of a series of posts about writing a digital logic simulator
in Rust. The goal is to be able to create and simulate a component-based
circuit.

# Introduction

What are digital circuits? Some "electronics" that operate on digital signals.
Digital signals can only have discrete values, in contrast with analog signals.

But what is a component-based circuit? Usually, digital circuits are made out
of other integrated circuits (also known as microchips). If you have ever seen
the inside of a usb flash drive, or maybe a RAM stick, they have this flat
black boxes surrounded with pins. But aren't all digital circuits
"component-based"?  Well, yes, but these components are made out of
transistors, not out of other components. The goal of this post series is to
make big components out of smaller components, all the way up to a simple
microprocessor.

Unfortunately we can't play with hardware, so we will have to make our own
simulator.  Of course there are already hundreds of digital logic simulators,
but using an existing one wouldn't be a challenge.

I will be using the Rust programming language, but you can follow this post
with a basic understanding of any other programming language, as long as it has
functions I guess. By this I mean there won't be anything Rust-specific in this
post.

# Let's begin!

Let's start with representing a digital bit. It can be either true (high) or
false (low), but using a boolean wouldn't be fun so we create an enum instead:

```rust
enum Bit {
    L, // Low, false, 0
    H, // High, true, 1
}
```

Now we need some way to play with this bits, some function that transforms a 1
into a 0, some kind of logic gate. One of the most basic logic gates is the
NOT gate. It's pretty simple: if the input is 0 the output is 1, and if the
input is 1 the output is 0. This can be represented with the following table:

```c
// NOT gate
// input = output
[L] = [H]
[H] = [L]
```

That table is called the truth table. But the NOT gate alone isn't very useful,
let's introduce more logic gates. The AND gate is pretty simple, it's true when
all of its inputs are true:

```c
// AND gate
// inputs = output
[L, L] = [L]
[L, H] = [L]
[H, L] = [L]
[H, H] = [H]
```

If we combine the AND gate with a NOT gate at its output, we get a NAND gate.
It's basically the inverse of the AND gate, its output is 0 when all of its
inputs are 1, and 0 otherwise. Here is the NAND truth table:

```c
// NAND gate
[L, L] = [H]
[L, H] = [H]
[H, L] = [H]
[H, H] = [L]
```

This gate may not seem very useful, but in fact it's a universal logic gate.
That means we can implement any logical function using only NAND gates.
Therefore, if we implement a NAND gate we won't have to implement any other
gates, they could be implemented as combinations of NAND gates! So let's do it.

```rust
fn nand2(a: Bit, b: Bit) -> Bit {
    match (a, b) {
        (Bit::L, Bit::L) => Bit::H,
        (Bit::L, Bit::H) => Bit::H,
        (Bit::H, Bit::L) => Bit::H,
        (Bit::H, Bit::H) => Bit::L,
    }
}
```

The Rust syntax may not be familiar to you so I'll explain this one. We define
a function called `nand2`, with two inputs `a` and `b`, both of type `Bit`,
and this function returns one output of type `Bit`. The `match` statement
represents the truth table, on the left we have the expected values of `a` and
`b`, and on the right the correponding output.

To prove that the NAND is a universal gate, we will implement another logic
gate using only NANDs. Let's implement the AND gate. Since a NAND is just a
negated AND, if we negate it again we will get a simple AND, just like negating
a number twice gets you the number back:

```rust
fn and2(a: Bit, b: Bit) -> Bit {
    let x = nand2(a, b);
    nand2(x, x)
}
```

We are using the NAND with x as the only (repeated) input, which basically
negates it. We must use it that way because we haven't created a 1-input NAND
gate yet, but as we see we don't even need it.  In Rust when the last line of a
function doesn't have a semicolon, it's the same as `return nand2(x, x);`.  You
may think I'm cheating because that one was pretty obvious, but don't worry,
soon we will make more complicated stuff.

The idea is to create new components out of existing components, using those
new components to make even more complex ones.  The problem is that we need a
nice way to chain gates together, creating complex components with simple
interfaces.

# Abstraction

Since a component is just like a function, a black box where we enter inputs
and we receive an output, let's implement it like that:

```rust
trait Component {
    fn update(&mut self, input: &[Bit]) -> Vec<Bit>;
}
```

This defines the `Component` "trait". In other languages it can be implemented
as an interface, or maybe even a parent class. Basically it defines a common
_trait_ for many objects.
For now our `Component`s will only have to implement the `update` function,
which takes `&[Bit]` (an array of Bits) and returns `Vec<Bit>` (also an array
of Bits), because sometimes we want to have more than one output. `&mut self`
means that we call this function on some instance, as:

```rust
let output = nand.update(input);
```

So let's re-implement our NAND gate as a `Component`. Since the `update`
function accepts any number of inputs, we will have to modify our NAND. We
could use recursion to implement a n-input NAND using the 2-input NAND, but
there is a simpler method. Since the output of the NAND is `H` (1) when any of
the inputs is `L` (0), we can just search the input array for any `L`:

```rust
fn nand(input: &[Bit]) -> Vec<Bit> {
    if input.iter().any(|&a| a == Bit::L) {
        vec![Bit::H]
    } else {
        vec![Bit::L]
    }
}
```

And just like that, we have a generic n-input NAND gate. `vec![]` is
a macro that defines a vector, in this case with only one element
since we want our output to be 1 bit. And that weird `any` function basically
searches for values `a` that satisfy `a == Bit::L`.

But we can't just implement the `Component` trait for a function, we need
to create some type. We will use the following `struct`:

```rust
struct Nand {
    num_inputs: usize,
}
impl Nand {
    fn new(num_inputs: usize) -> Nand {
        Nand { num_inputs }
    }
}
```

Now when creating a NAND gate we have to call `Nand::new(n)`, where n is the
number of inputs. The type of n is `usize`, which is an unsigned integer.
We could avoid that n and use the n-input NAND for everything but this way we
are dealing with "real" gates, not some abstract functions. For the purposes of
this posts, we will want our gates to have a defined number of inputs and
outputs.

Let's finally implement `Component`:

```rust
impl Component for Nand {
    fn update(&mut self, input: &[Bit]) -> Vec<Bit> {
        assert_eq!(self.num_inputs, input.len());
        if input.iter().any(|&a| a == Bit::L) {
            vec![Bit::H]
        } else {
            vec![Bit::L]
        }
    }
}
```

The only difference is that now we check the number of inputs using the
`assert_eq!` macro, which checks if two elements are equal, and if they aren't
it panics and aborts the program.  The `update` function doesn't need to take
`&mut self`, `&self` would be enough (because we don't want to change (mutate)
the number of inputs after creating a gate), but more complex components will
need `&mut self`.

So let's do something to try this code, this time it will be a 2-input OR gate.
The OR gate output is true when any of its inputs is true. We will use the
following identity, which can be implemented using 3 NAND gates:

![OR_from_NAND.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/OR_from_NAND.svg)

`A OR B == NOT(A) NAND NOT(B)`

```rust
struct Or2 {
    nand_a: Nand,
    nand_b: Nand,
    nand_c: Nand,
}
impl Or2 {
    fn new() -> Or2 {
        Or2 {
            nand_a: Nand::new(1),
            nand_b: Nand::new(1),
            nand_c: Nand::new(2),
        }
    }
}
impl Component for Or2 {
    fn update(&mut self, input: &[Bit]) -> Vec<Bit> {
        assert_eq!(input.len(), 2);
        let a = input[0];
        let b = input[1];
        let not_a = self.nand_a.update(&[a])[0];
        let not_b = self.nand_b.update(&[b])[0];
        // not_a nand not_b == a or b
        self.nand_c.update(&[not_a, not_b])
    }
}
```

Try it online:

And here is the truth table, as one would expect from an OR gate:

```c
[L, L] = [L]
[L, H] = [H]
[H, L] = [H]
[H, H] = [H]
```

If you look at the code above you may think that this way is worse than the
old generic `nand` function approach. You also may be wondering why we create
two identical 1-input NANDs when one would be enough. The point is to not think
about NAND gates, but about components. We could replace the 1-input NANDs with
other 1-input and 1-output components and the code wouldn't change. The only
problem is that the connections between those components are fixed in the code.
That will be our goal: a generic component interconnection, a way to give our
program a list of components and connections between them, and simulate the
circuit as a whole.

# Conclusion.

We have seen various ways of implementing a NAND gate, and using this gate as a
building block for more complex components. In the next post we will see a
different (even more complicated) way to implement the OR gate, which hopefully
will lead us to a generic way of representing a series of interconnected
components.
