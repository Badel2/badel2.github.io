title: Writing a digital logic simulator - Part 2
---

In this post we will define the architecture of the simulator.

# Previous posts

[Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/comphdl-01)

The first post was a short introduction to digital logic and Rust, we created a
NAND gate, and used it to build an OR gate. But the connections between gates
were set implicitly in the code, in this post we will make them real.

# The structural struct

So we need a generic way of representing components and their connections.
Here we go:

```rust
struct Structural {
    components: Vec<Component>,
    connections: Vec<Connection>,
}
```

A `Structural` is a collection of components and connections. I gave it this
name because a structural architecture is exactly that, interconections between
components. The implementation from above looks too simple, but it could work.

If you just want to see the finished implementation, the code is available at
the end of this post, but for now let's think how to implement a `Connection`:

```rust
struct Connection {
    from: Index,
    to: Vec<Index>,
    value: Bit,
}
```

Maybe it could be a `Bit` with additional `from` and `to` properties. It is
important that one output can be connected to multiple inputs (hence `to` is a
`Vec<Index>`), but if two outputs are connected together there could be a short
circuit, and that's bad, so we won't allow it. But this way, to get all the
connections from some `Index` we need to search the entire vector. Since the
from field should be unique, we can transform it into:

```rust
HashMap<Index, (Vec<Index>, Bit)>
// let (to, value) = hashmap[from];
```

Given an index return all the indexes connected to it. But what is an `Index`?
Well, we could just store all the internal signals (the inputs and outputs of
all the components) together, as a vector, and then indexing this vector would
give us any input or output. Or we could store the signals as a `Vec<Vec<Bit>>`
and make the `Index` a pair `(component_id, port_id)` where we first index by
`component_id` and then by `port_id`. This way given an index we can see to
which component it pertains, and to which input it is connected to, and all the
inputs of one component are stored together. Since the only way to interface
with internal components is via the `update` method, which requires us to pass
all of the inputs together, storing all the inputs as a separated vector will
probably be faster than searching all the inputs in a vector or a hashmap.

But we also need to:

* Get all the connections of the inputs from outside.

* Get all the outputs of the `Structural` to outside.

* Given an internal component, get all its inputs.

* Given an internal component, get all the connections of its outputs.


But how do we know how many inputs and outputs does this `Structural` component
have? Since it can be any number, we need to store it somewhere.  Well, let's
update the definition of the `Component` trait, adding the number of inputs and
outputs, and also the name because we will need to identificate components at
some point.

```rust
trait Component {
    fn update(&mut self, input: &[Bit]) -> Vec<Bit>;
    fn num_inputs(&self) -> usize;
    fn num_outputs(&self) -> usize;
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
}
```

After thinking a while, this is what I came up with:

```rust
struct Structural {
    components: Vec<CompIo>,
    num_inputs: usize,
    num_outputs: usize,
    name: String,
}
struct CompIo {
    comp: Box<Component>,
    input: Vec<Bit>,
    output: Vec<Bit>,
    connections: Vec<Vec<Index>>,
}
struct Index {
    comp_id: usize,
    input_id: usize,
}
```

Maybe I abused the vector container a bit, but this looks like it's going to
work. For every component we create a `CompIo` struct which tracks its inputs,
outputs, and connections. Nice! Oh, and since `Component` is a trait we need to
`Box` it to be able to store a generic `Component`. A `Box` is just an owned
pointer, if that helps. The connections are represented as a
`Vec<Vec<Index>>`, so to get the connections of the first output we do `let con
= connections[0];`, and that returns a `Vec<Index>` of all the connections.
The only think left is how to deal with the special case of outputs to the
outside, the ones we return on `update`, where do we store them? One solution
is to have a special component which doesn't do anything but we use it as an
interface with the outside. This will be the component 0.

But before implementing it, let's see how we would create components this way.
We will try to create the OR from last post:

![OR_from_NAND.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/OR_from_NAND.svg)

```rust
// Create the special component 0
let mut c_zero = CompIo::c_zero(2, 1); // 2 inputs, 1 output, c_id: 0
// Create the actual components
let mut nand_a = CompIo::new(Box::new(Nand::new(1))); // c_id: 1
let mut nand_b = CompIo::new(Box::new(Nand::new(1))); // c_id: 2
let mut nand_c = CompIo::new(Box::new(Nand::new(2))); // c_id: 3

//comp.add_connection(output_id, Index::new(component_id, input_id);
c_zero.add_connection(0, Index::new(1, 0)); // input 0 -> nand_a
c_zero.add_connection(1, Index::new(2, 0)); // input 1 -> nand_b
nand_a.add_connection(0, Index::new(3, 0)); // nand_a -> nand_c(0)
nand_b.add_connection(0, Index::new(3, 1)); // nand_b -> nand_c(1)
nand_c.add_connection(0, Index::new(0, 0)); // output of nand_c == output of or

let c = vec![c_zero, nand_a, nand_b, nand_c];
let mut or_gate = Structural::new(c, 2, 1, "OR2");
```

First we create the components, we need to box the NAND gates to store them as
`Component`s. I annotated the component index (`c_id`) as a comment, that is
the index of this component in the `c` vector that we pass to `Structural::new`
on the last line. The connections are defined with a simple interface. We pass
the `output_id` (with the exception of `c_zero` where we pass the `input_id`),
and make an `Index` from the `component_id` and `input_id` where this output
will be connected (again with the exception of `c_zero`, if we want to connect
something to the output of the structural we call `Index::new(0, 0)`).  It isn't
as bad as it looks, we just have to be careful with the indexes.  But most
importantly, once we `impl Component for Structural` we will be able to nest
components like crazy, so let's begin!

```rust
impl CompIo {
    fn new(comp: Box<Component>) -> CompIo {
        let input = vec![Bit::X; comp.num_inputs()];
        let output = vec![Bit::X; comp.num_outputs()];
        let connections = vec![vec![]; comp.num_outputs()];
        CompIo { comp, input, output, connections }
    }
    fn add_connection(&mut self, output_id: usize, to: Index) {
        self.connections[output_id].push(to);
    }
}
```

`CompIo` is pretty straightforward: we allocate the input and output vectors
with the given size, and we leave the connections empty. By default, the
component will not be connected to anything. We are initializing
the inputs as `Bit::X`, a new variant of `Bit` which means undefined.
This way we can catch floating pins.

```rust
enum Bit {
    L, // Low, false, 0
    H, // High, true, 1
    X, // Undefined
}
```

`X` can be seen as the default state
when we power on the circuit: from a programmer's perpective we can call it
uninitialized. It may have a valid value, but we shouldn't use it.
But we can use it, and then it behaves like it's both 0 and 1 until we
observe it. For example, the OR gate with undefined inputs:

```c
[H, L] = [H]
[H, H] = [H]
[H, X] = [H]
[L, L] = [L]
[L, H] = [H]
[L, X] = [X]
```

When one input is 1, the output is always 1, even with an X. But `0 OR X` could
be either 1 or 0 so it stays as X. Another interpretation would be a short
circuit: if we connect two outputs together, and one output is 0 and the other
is 1, then the result is an X. We should also update our NAND gate to deal with
undefined inputs, and also implement the new methods of the `Component` trait:

```rust
impl Component for Nand {
    fn update(&mut self, input: &[Bit]) -> Vec<Bit> {
        assert_eq!(self.num_inputs, input.len());
        let mut x = Bit::L;
        for a in input {
            match *a {
                // If any input is 0, the output is 1
                Bit::L => return vec![Bit::H],
                // X NAND L = H, but X NAND H = X
                Bit::X => x = Bit::X,
                Bit::H => {},
            }
        }

        vec![x]
    }
    fn num_inputs(&self) -> usize {
        self.num_inputs
    }
    fn num_outputs(&self) -> usize {
        1
    }
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "NAND"
    }
}
```

Now if we test our implementation of the OR gate from the previous post
with undefined inputs, we see that it actually works as expected.

```c
[X, L] = [X]
[L, X] = [X]
[X, H] = [H]
[H, X] = [H]
```

It actually works! This means that we can change the `update` of the NAND gate,
and since our components are just combinations of NAND gates, they will keep
working as expected. But let's keep working on the `CompIo`. The
`CompIo::c_zero` function is identical to the `CompIo::new`, but the "input" of
component 0 is the output of the `Structural`, because if we are inside the
component, we read the inputs just like we read the outputs of the other
components. So we just need to swap num_inputs and num_outputs. And then, in
`Structural::new` we verify that assumption.

```rust
impl Structural {
    fn new(components: Vec<CompIo>, num_inputs: usize, num_outputs: usize,
           name: &str) -> Structural {
        // Component 0 must have been created using CompIo::c_zero
        assert_eq!(components[0].input.len(), num_outputs);
        assert_eq!(components[0].output.len(), num_inputs);
        assert_eq!(components[0].connections.len(), num_inputs);
        // TODO: check that all the connections are valid
        let name = name.to_string();
        Structural { components, num_inputs, num_outputs, name }
    }
}
```

We already have the information about the number of inputs and outputs stored in
component 0, but we pass it to `new` as a form of error checking. So let's
`impl Component for Structural`:

```rust
impl Component for Structural {
    fn update(&mut self, input: &[Bit]) -> Vec<Bit> {
        assert_eq!(input.len(), self.num_inputs());
        // Propagate input
        self.propagate_input(input);
        // Update components
        self.update_components();
        // Propagate internal signals
        self.propagate_signals();
        // Return the component output
        self.output()
    }
    fn num_inputs(&self) -> usize {
        self.num_inputs
    }
    fn num_outputs(&self) -> usize {
        self.num_outputs
    }
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.name
    }
}
```

"Hey what's with all that useless comments? I want to see the actual
implementation!" Don't worry, there is a reason why I structured it that way.

# The order of the updates

It's very important that the order of the updates doesn't affect the end
result.  In our OR gate the 2-input NAND must be updated the last, after the
signal of the 1-input NANDs arrives to it. If we first updated the 2-input
NAND, the output wouldn't match our expectations. But how do we know the right
order? Well, we could go left to right but the truth is that we don't know,
there may be loops in the circuit and then there isn't a right order. So we
give up, and follow some order that won't affect the result. That order is the
following:

* Propagate input: so the components have the correct input when updated

* Update components: but don't propagate the updates yet

* Propagate signals: after updating all the components, propagate the changes

This way we make sure our simulator is "commutative". The order in which we
update the components doesn't affect the result. This means that we can update
all the components at once and get that sweet multi-thread performance bonus.
Maybe later.  For now, let's see how these functions are implemented.

```rust
fn propagate(&mut self, c_id: usize) {
    // TODO: avoid this clone
    let connections = self.components[c_id].connections.clone();
    for (out_id, to) in connections.iter().enumerate() {
        for i in to {
            self.components[i.comp_id]
                .input[i.input_id] = self.components[c_id].output[out_id];
        }
    }
}
fn propagate_input(&mut self, input: &[Bit]) {
    // The input is an output when seen from inside
    self.components[0].output = input.to_vec();
    self.propagate(0);
}
fn propagate_signals(&mut self) {
    for c in 1..self.components.len() {
        self.propagate(c);
    }
}
fn output(&self) -> Vec<Bit> {
    self.components[0].input.clone()
}
fn update_components(&mut self) {
    for c in 1..self.components.len() {
        // Magic pattern matching to make the borrow checker happy
        let CompIo {
            ref mut comp,
            ref input,
            ref mut output,
            connections: _
        } = self.components[c];
        *output = comp.update(input);
    }
}
```

The code may be a bit long but it's self explanatory, especially the
`update_components` function which is just beautiful. Note that we skip the
component 0, because it isn't meant to be updated. Calling `update` on it
should result in a panic. Oh, I forgot to mention what exactly is the component
0... It's just a 0-input NAND. So it will indeed panic when updated with more
than 0 inputs. As for the propagate function, it just iterates every output and
updates all of its possible connections.

# Structural OR

Alright, let's finally see the truth table of our new Structural OR gate:

```c
[L, L] = [X]
[L, H] = [L]
[H, L] = [H]
[H, H] = [H]
```

Well... That isn't quite an OR gate. What's happening? Well, remember that
specific order of updates I mentioned earlier? It turns out that since all
the components are updated at once, they can't interact with each other.
But don't worry, that's not a problem, because we just need to wait one
update more for the signal to propagate. If we execute every input 3 times...

```c
[L, L] = [X]
[L, L] = [L]
[L, L] = [L]
[L, H] = [L]
[L, H] = [H]
[L, H] = [H]
[H, L] = [H]
[H, L] = [H]
[H, L] = [H]
[H, H] = [H]
[H, H] = [H]
[H, H] = [H]
```

Each line is an `or_gate.update(&i)`, and they are executed sequentally, so
we see the correct output after one update. From now on, we will call every
update a "tick", so our OR gate has a 1-tick delay. Let's put a few OR
gates in series to see how they behave.

# OR-OR-OR

![triple-or](https://imgur.com/VLofJ3N.png)

```rust
let mut c_zero = CompIo::c_zero(1, 1); // c_id: 0
let mut or_a = CompIo::new(boxed_or_gate()); // c_id: 1
let mut or_b = CompIo::new(boxed_or_gate()); // c_id: 2
let mut or_c = CompIo::new(boxed_or_gate()); // c_id: 3

c_zero.add_connection(0, Index::new(1, 0)); // input 0 -> or_a
c_zero.add_connection(0, Index::new(1, 1)); // input 0 -> or_a
or_a.add_connection(0, Index::new(2, 0)); // or_a -> or_b
or_a.add_connection(0, Index::new(2, 1)); // or_a -> or_b
or_b.add_connection(0, Index::new(3, 0)); // or_b -> or_c
or_b.add_connection(0, Index::new(3, 1)); // or_b -> or_c
or_c.add_connection(0, Index::new(0, 0)); // output
```

Now thanks to this new syntax, with just a few changes we have created
something completely different. The `boxed_or_gate` is just a function that
returns the OR gate we defined at the beginning. For simplicity, I just
connected the same input twice to every gate, so our OR gate is now a simple
buffer. We have put 3 OR gates in series, so the expected delay should be 3
ticks:

```c
[L] = [X]
[L] = [X]
[L] = [X]
[H] = [X]
[H] = [X]
[H] = [L]
[L] = [L]
[L] = [L]
[L] = [H]
[H] = [H]
[H] = [H]
[H] = [L]
```

Whaaat? 5 ticks? Why? Well, let's see what's happening: assume every `>` is an
OR gate:

```c
t=0  0>X>X>X
t=1  0>0>X>X
t=2  0>0>X>X
t=3  1>0>0>X
t=4  1>1>0>X
t=5  1>1>0>0
```

Since we first update the gates and then propagate the signals, the output of
the first gate is only avaliable to the second gate at t=2. Well, it is there
at t=1, but then the second gate has already updated its state. This means that
every connection adds 1 tick of delay, which should have been obvious because
our NAND gates are 0-tick and combining 2 of them in series made a 1-tick OR
gate. This isn't a problem because we can just scale everything up, make our
inputs change only once per 100 ticks and only display the output at that time.
Also, this approach is more realistic, because real logic gates have a small
propagation delay (known as tpd, usually arround 10ns).

As a side note, we could use this triple OR buffer as a memory device, it can
store a total of 5 bits, 1 per tick. We will explore the different memory
storage strategies in a future post.

But let's see why we have chosen this approach instead of recursively updating
all the components that need updates. What happens if we make a loop?

![nand-short](https://imgur.com/tYMjbPa.png)

```rust
let mut c_zero = CompIo::c_zero(1, 1); // c_id: 0
let mut nand_a = CompIo::new(Box::new(Nand::new(2))); // c_id: 1

c_zero.add_connection(0, Index::new(1, 0)); // input 0 -> nand_a
nand_a.add_connection(0, Index::new(1, 1)); // nand_a -> nand_a
nand_a.add_connection(0, Index::new(0, 0)); // nand_a -> out
```

And let's see the truth table:

```c
[L] = [H]
[L] = [H]
[L] = [H]
[L] = [H]
[L] = [H]
[L] = [H]
[H] = [L]
[H] = [H]
[H] = [L]
[H] = [H]
[H] = [L]
[H] = [H]
```

See, when the input is 0, the output is 1 and everything is fine, but when the
output is 1 and we set the input to 1, the output should be 0 but if it's 0
then the NAND gate's input is 0 and the output is 1 and everything breaks. In
our implementation this means that the output keeps changing between 0 and 1 on
every update, which isn't ideal but it's better than a crash. While it should
be possible to detect this loops and just set the connections to X, it is
harder than it sounds, sometimes these loops span hundreds of components,
finding them would require a sophisticated analysis of the circuit as a whole.

# Conclusion

That should be enough for now. In the next post we will improve the simulation
experience, because looking at a series of `[L] = `[H]` lines isn't very user
friendly.
