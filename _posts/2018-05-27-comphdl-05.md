We have a working digital logic simulator: we can create components and
run simulations, however creating components is a pain.

For example, this is how we would create a simple two-input OR gate,
using NAND gates as shown in the following image:

![Or2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/OR_from_NAND.svg)

```rust
let mut c_zero = CompIo::c_zero(2, 1); // c_id: 0
let mut nand_a = CompIo::new(Box::new(Nand::new(1))); // c_id: 1
let mut nand_b = CompIo::new(Box::new(Nand::new(1))); // c_id: 2
let mut nand_c = CompIo::new(Box::new(Nand::new(2))); // c_id: 3

c_zero.add_connection(0, Index::new(1, 0)); // input 0 -> nand_a
c_zero.add_connection(1, Index::new(2, 0)); // input 1 -> nand_b
nand_a.add_connection(0, Index::new(3, 0)); // nand_a -> nand_c
nand_b.add_connection(0, Index::new(3, 1)); // nand_b -> nand_c
nand_c.add_connection(0, Index::new(0, 0)); // output of nand_c == output of or

let c = vec![c_zero, nand_a, nand_b, nand_c];
let pn = PortNames::new(&["A", "B"], &["Q"]);
let or_gate = Structural::new(c, 2, 1, "OR2", pn);
```

And this is one of the simplest components, it gets worse.

# Introduction

We want to create components in a simple way. For example, defining them
in an external file, so they can be parsed at runtime. What about the
syntax? Well, since a component is similar to a function, let's use the
function syntax:

```rust
component Or2(a, b) -> x {
    // ...
}
```

Since we only have one data type: `Bit`, we don't need to specify the type
of every variable. We only need to distinguish between inputs and outputs,
and we do that by separating them with the arrow "`->`".

And we could also put the component definition there, creating a nice little
programming language: CompHDL (Component Hardware Description Language).

Ok, good idea, but how do we implement it? 
The final code is available on
[github](https://github.com/Badel2/comphdl/tree/blog-05)
.

# Writing a parser

We could write a parser from scratch, but that is usually a pain. To solve this
problem there exist many parser generator frameworks (libraries). In the Rust
ecosystem we have
[nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom),
[peg](https://github.com/kevinmehall/rust-peg),
[pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest),
[combine](https://github.com/Marwes/combine), and
[LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop), to name a few.

All of them have their benefits, and a corresponding learning curve. Since we
don't care about performance, let's chose the one that looks simpler to use.
That would be LALRPOP. It says that right in the README: _a parser generator
framework with usability as its primary goal_. And it even has a nice tutorial.
Let's see how it works.

After the initial setup, we create a file named `src/comphdl1.lalrpop`. Here we
will define our rules, and the build script will compile these rules into a
`src/comphdl1.rs` file, which will be used by our program. For example, the
component definition would be:

```rust
pub CompDef: String = {
    "component" Name Inputs "->" Outputs "{" CompBody "}" => {
        String::new()
    }
};
```

Pretty simple, right? We define the `CompDef` nonterminal, which returns a
`String`, and matches for the "component" literal, followed by `Name`, etc.
`Name` is another nonterminal (a nonterminal is something that can be parsed)
which we will have to define later. All this terms can optionally be separated
by whitespace and new lines, so we don't need to worry about explicitly adding
optional whitespace everywhere. Finally we have a `=>` which begins the "body"
of this term. In the body we can write any Rust code, in this case we need a
`String` so we create an empty one, let's see how to create a useful one:

```rust
pub CompDef: String = {
    "component" <n: Name> <i: Inputs> "->" <o: Outputs> "{" CompBody "}" => {
        format!("{:?} {:?} {:?}", n, i, o)
    }
};
```

We capture some of the terms by enclosing them with `<` and `>`, like html
tags. We assign a name to them, and then use `format!` to build a `String` with
all the information that we want. This way we can debug the program, running
tests to see what matches and what not.

But for now let's keep defining:

```rust
pub Word: String = {
    r"(\w+)" => format!("{}", <>)
};

pub Name = Word;
```

We define what is a `Word`, and then we say that a `Name` is just a `Word`.
This one doesn't use a literal, but a regex. A regex is basically an expression
which in this case will match exactly one word, as "`\w+`" means "one or more
alphanumeric characters".

And that weird thing on the right (`<>`) is a short way to capture everything,
it would be equivalent to x if we do `<x: r"(\w+)">`.

Now, the inputs. That will be tricky because we want to allow any number of
inputs, from zero to infinity. Luckly for us there is an example in the LALRPOP
documentation that captures a comma separated list. So we just copy that
without even understanding what it does, like real programmers.

```rust
pub VarArgs = Comma<Word>;

// Matches anything from "" to "a,b,c" or even "a,"
Comma<T>: Vec<T> = {
    <v:(<T> ",")*> <e:T?> => match e {
        None => v,
        Some(e) => {
            let mut v = v;
            v.push(e);
            v
        }
    }
};
```

We define `VarArgs` as a comma separated list of `Word`s, so it returns a
`Vec<String>`. This leaves the `Inputs` as a comma separated list enclosed in
parentheses:

```rust
pub Inputs: Vec<String> = {
    "(" <VarArgs> ")",
};
```

Here we don't explicitly specify the return because we only capture one
element, so that element is the output by default. So for the inputs we
match anything like `()`,
`(a)`, `(a,)`, `(a,b, c,d)`, etc. But for the outputs we also want to allow
`x`, without parentheses, when there is only one output.

```rust
pub Outputs: Vec<String> = {
    // (a, b)
    "(" <VarArgs> ")",
    // x
    Word => vec![<>],
};
```

This will try to match any of the two options: either `(a, b)` syntax, or a
single word. In the second case, we return a one element vector, so `x` is
equivalent to `(x)`.  It is very important that, unlike Rust's `match`, LALRPOP
will try to evaluate all the possibilities at once, so we can't have
conflicting syntax (see [Appendix 2](#appendix2)).

We can test it using the following lines of code:

```rust
let def = comphdl1::CompDefParser::new().parse("component Or2(a, b) -> q { }");
println!("{}", def.unwrap());
```

Which outputs:

```rust
"Or2" ["a", "b"] ["q"]
```

Nice, it works, but we can only parse one component. If we add something after
the "}" we get a nice error: `UnrecognizedToken { token: Some((45, Token(9,
"component"), 54)), expected: [] }`

So we will define a new nonterminal,
`File`, which matches any sequence of `CompDef`:

```rust
pub File: Vec<String> = {
    CompDef*
};
```

The syntax is actually similar to the definition of `Comma`, but simpler. The
`*` indicates "a sequence of", so here we take a sequence of `CompDef`, so the
return type is "a sequence of `String`": a `Vec<String>`. Since we only have
one element it simplifies the syntax, but it would be equivalent to `<v:
CompDef*> => v`. Let's see more examples:

```rust
component Or2(a, b,) -> (x,) { }
"Or2" ["a", "b"] ["x"]

component Mux_4_1(s1, s0, a, b, c, d) -> y { }
"Mux_4_1" ["s1", "s0", "a", "b", "c", "d"] ["y"]
```
We can even add trailing commas. But what if a component has zero outputs?

```rust
component Log(a) -> () { }
"Log" ["a"] []

component SetLeds(a, b, c) -> () { }
"SetLeds" ["a", "b", "c"] []
```

Well, if we follow the syntax rules it works, but what about some shorter
versions?

```rust
component Log(a) { }
component SetLeds(a, b, c) { }
```

It doesn't work because we would need to make the `-> ()` optional.
Luckly, LALRPOP makes this very easy. Just like we can use a
`*` to take "a sequence of", we can also use a "?" to make something optional.

```rust
pub CompDef: String = {
    "component" <n: Name> <i: Inputs> <o: ("->" <Outputs>)?> "{" CompBody "}" => {
        format!("{:?} {:?} {:?}", n, i, o)
    }
};
```

The syntax is slightly complicated because we don't want to capture everything,
let me explain it step by step. Here we have a syntax rule and its
corresponding return type:

```rust
("->" Outputs)
    (&str, Vec<String>)
("->" Outputs)?
    Option<(&str, Vec<String>)>
<o: ("->" Outputs)?>
    Option<(&str, Vec<String>)>
<o: ("->" <Outputs>)?>
    Option<Vec<String>>
```

Let's try it with the inputs from before:

```rust
"Log" ["a"] None
"SetLeds" ["a", "b", "c"] None
```

Nice, it works! But wait... Now instead of a `Vec<String>` we have a
`Option<Vec<String>>`.  We wanted `"Log" ["a"] []` and we got `"Log" ["a"]
None`. Also, we shouldn't return a simple `String`, so let's add a better
interface.

# CompInfo

```rust
pub struct CompInfo {
    name: String,
    inputs: Vec<String>,
    outputs: Vec<String>,
}
impl CompInfo {
    pub fn new(name: String, inputs: Vec<String>, outputs: Vec<String>) -> CompInfo {
        CompInfo { name, inputs, outputs }
    }
}
```

We put this definition in `src/parser.rs` and import it into
`src/comphdl.lalrpop` by adding `use parser::CompInfo;` at the top. Using it is
very simple, let's redefine `CompDef` again:

```rust
pub CompDef: CompInfo = {
    "component" <n: Name> <i: Inputs> <o:("->" <Outputs>)?> "{" CompBody "}" => {
        let o = o.unwrap_or(vec![]);
        CompInfo::new(n, i, o)
    }
};
```

Now instead of returning a `String` we return a `CompInfo` struct with all
the information. Notice how we convert the outputs from `Option<Vec<String>>`
to `Vec<String>` using `o.unwrap_or(vec![])`. This converts `Some(x)` into `x`,
and `None` into `vec![]`, just like we wanted.
This just leaves the `CompBody` definition since we 
don't know how it will look like.

# CompBody

What should be the syntax for defining connections between components?
Let's consider the following examples:

```rust
component Or2(a, b) -> x { // (1)
    x = !(!a, !b);
}
component Or2(a, b) -> x { // (2)
    n_a = Nand(a);
    n_b = Nand(b);
    x = Nand(n_a, n_b);
}
component Or2(a, b) -> x { // (3)
    return Nand(Nand(a), Nand(b));
}
component Or2(a, b) -> x { // (4)
    let nand0: Nand(1);
    let nand1: Nand(1);
    let nand2: Nand(2);
    nand0.i0 = a;
    nand0.o0 = nand2.i0;
    nand1.i0 = b;
    nand1.o0 = nand2.i1;
    nand2.o0 = x;
}
```

Option 2 is the most sane. Option 1 also looks nice, but using `!` is just a
special case, for other components it would look the same as option 2. Option 3
doesn't make much sense, since we aren't actually returning anything, but
that's how you would do it in other programming languages. Finally option 4 is
the explicit one: we create the components, assign its inputs, and assign its
outputs to other components.

But why creating a new syntax when we already got the component definition?
We could easily modify it and use it like this:

```rust
component Or2(a, b) -> x { // (5)
    Nand(a) -> n_a;
    Nand(b) -> n_b;
    Nand(n_a, n_b) -> x;
}
```

This option is my favorite, because we don't have to write new parsing code.
We must define the internal signals `n_a` and `n_b`, but defining them is as
simple as using them somewhere.

The connections can be computed by finding all the components
that use this signal name as one of its inputs or outputs.

Let's see how we would do that in LALRPOP:

```rust
pub CompBody: Vec<CompInfo> = {
    <v:(<CompCall> ";")*> => v
};
pub CompCall: CompInfo = {
    <n: Name> <i: Inputs> <o:("->" <Outputs>)?> => {
        let o = o.unwrap_or(vec![]);
        CompInfo::new(n, i, o)
    }
};
pub CompDef: (CompInfo, Vec<CompInfo>) = {
    "component" <CompCall> "{" <CompBody> "}"
};
```

We create the `CompCall` nonterminal, and use it as a building block for
`CompBody` and `CompDef`. Yes, I just removed the "component" keyword and the
"{ }" from `CompDef`, but that's all we need. Now `CompBody` is a sequence of
`CompCall` followed by `";"`, and `CompDef` is just a `CompCall` with a
`CompBody` enclosed in `"{ }"`. Notice how its return type is `(CompInfo,
Vec<CompInfo>)`, which represents the component definition (one `CompCall`, the
one with a `{`), and a vector with all the statements (multiple `CompCall`s,
the ones with `;`) inside.

Of course, we also need to update the `File` definition:

```rust
pub File: Vec<(CompInfo, Vec<CompInfo>)> = {
    CompDef*
};
```

Let's see how well it parses our components.

```rust
component Or2(a, b,) -> (x,) {
    Nand(a) -> n_a;
    Nand(b) -> n_b;
    Nand(n_a, n_b) -> x;
}

CompInfo { name: "Or2", inputs: ["a", "b"], outputs: ["x"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["a"], outputs: ["n_a"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["b"], outputs: ["n_b"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["n_a", "n_b"], outputs: ["x"] }

component Mux_4_1(s1, s0, a, b, c, d) -> y {
    Nand(s1) -> n_s1;
    Nand(s0) -> n_s0;
    Nand(n_s0, n_s1, a) -> sel00;
    Nand(n_s0,   s1, b) -> sel01;
    Nand(  s0, n_s1, c) -> sel10;
    Nand(  s0,   s1, d) -> sel11;
    Nand( sel00, sel01, sel10, sel11) -> y;
}

CompInfo { name: "Mux_4_1", inputs: ["s1", "s0", "a", "b", "c", "d"], outputs: ["y"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["s1"], outputs: ["n_s1"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["s0"], outputs: ["n_s0"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["n_s0", "n_s1", "a"], outputs: ["sel00"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["n_s0", "s1", "b"], outputs: ["sel01"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["s0", "n_s1", "c"], outputs: ["sel10"] }
> CompInfo { name: "Nand", inputs: ["s0", "s1", "d"], outputs: ["sel11"] }
```

# Assignments

Even though I thought this syntax is perfect, it has one big flaw: there is no
way to assign an input directly to an output! Creating a non-inverting
buffer is impossible, so it looks like we need assignments after all.

```rust
component Buf(d) -> q {
    q = d;
}
```

Since this syntax is mostly a workarround for this one edge case, the
implementation isn't exactly great.
```rust
pub Assignment: CompInfo = {
    <a: Outputs> "=" <b: Outputs> => {
        CompInfo::new("actually, I'm just an assignment".into(),
            b,
            a
        )
    }
};
```

We treat `a = b` as `Assign(b) -> a`, wait maybe that would have been a better
syntax? Anyway, we return a `CompInfo` with all the information we need.
While we are at it, let's also add comments. We will allow three types of
comments: `/* comment */` , `//comment` and `#comment`.
```rust
pub Comment = {
    // C-style (non-nested)
    r"/[*]([^*]|([*][^/]))*[*]/",
    // C++
    r"//.*",
    // Python
    r"#.*",
};
```

We use regex to match the comments. Now we must update the `CompBody`
definition to support assignments and comments, let's do it:

```rust
pub BodyStatement: Option<CompInfo> = {
    <CompCall> ";" => Some(<>),
    <Assignment> ";" => Some(<>),
    Comment => None,
};
pub CompBody: Vec<CompInfo> = {
    <v: BodyStatement*> => {
        v.into_iter().filter_map(|x| x).collect()
    }
};
```

We create the `BodyStatement` non-terminal, which will match either a
`CompCall`, an `Assignment`, or a `Comment`.
This has the limitation that comments can only appear between statements.
Since the `Comment` doesn't return
a `CompInfo`, the return type of `BodyStatement` must be `Option<CompInfo>` (in
the future it should be a dedicated enum). We map `CompCall` and `Assignment`
to `Some(x)` and `Comment` to `None`.

Next, the `CompBody` is a sequence of `BodyStatements`, so we can capture it
with a `*`. However we must convert the `Vec<Option<CompInfo>>` into
`Vec<CompInfo>`, so we use `filter_map` which basically converts `[Some(1),
None, Some(2)]` into `[1, 2]`, filtering the `None` elements from the vector.

Anyway, now that the language is mostly defined we need to convert
these `CompInfo` into `Component`s to be able to simulate anything. Since that
should be pretty straight-forward, I will explain it in the next post (spoiler:
we make a `ComponentFactory`). For now let's just simulate something new to see
how easy it is to design components with this syntax.

# The demultiplexer

Just like we can use a multiplexer to select 1 from N inputs, the demultiplexer
takes 1 input and selects one of the N outputs which will be set to that value.
Here we have its truth table, S1 and S0 are the selection inputs, `I` is the
data input and FN are the data outputs. It this case we have 4 outputs, so we
need 2 selection inputs (F = 2^S).

```c
S1 S0  F0 F1 F2 F3
 0  0   I  0  0  0
 0  1   0  I  0  0
 1  0   0  0  I  0
 1  1   0  0  0  I
```

This can be useful because it allows us to address any of the N outputs, so for
example if we have 16 memory cells and we want to reset one of them, we don't
need 16 signals, one for each value, we only need 5 signals: 1 for the reset
signal itself and 4 for the address (because 2^4 = 16). Of course it has the
downside that we can only activate one output at a time. Let's see how we would
create a demultiplexer using the new syntax:

```rust
component Buf (d) -> q { d = q; }
component Not (a) -> q { Nand(a) -> q; }

component And3(a, b, c) -> x {
    Nand(a, b, c) -> n_x;
    Not(n_x) -> x;
}

component Demux_1_4(s1, s0, i) -> (f0, f1, f2, f3) {
    Buf(i)  -> d_i;
    Buf(s1) -> d_s1; Buf(s0) -> d_s0;
    Not(s1) -> n_s1; Not(s0) -> n_s0;
    And3(n_s1, n_s0, d_i) -> f0;
    And3(n_s1, d_s0, d_i) -> f1;
    And3(d_s1, n_s0, d_i) -> f2;
    And3(d_s1, d_s0, d_i) -> f3;
}
```

Nice and simple. We begin by declaring some helper components because our
language doesn't have a standard library yet, the only builtin component is the
Nand. The demultiplexer is just one 3-input AND gate for each of the 4 outputs,
each AND gate has a unique combination of `{n_s1, d_s1}` and `{n_s0, d_s0}`,
where `n_` is the inverted signal and `d_` is the delayed signal (this way we
avoid glitches). Here we can visualize the circuit, thanks to
[netlistsvg](https://nturley.github.io/netlistsvg/):

![Imgur](https://imgur.com/IILsORb.png)

And finally the simulation, using gtkwave to view the output:

![Imgur](https://imgur.com/oFZOwUn.png)

The 3 top rows are the inputs: `S1, S0, I`. 
We can see how it works as expected: all the outputs are set to 0 except the
selected one, which is set to `I`. There is a small delay between inputs
and outputs, exactly 2 ns.

# Conclusion

Parsing is hard. But it's worth it, now the complexity of the components isn't
a problem. I'm impressed how something that simple can make a big difference,
maybe there are more workflows out there that could be optimized with a simple
parser? And the best part is that we don't need to recompile every time we want
to test a new component, which is important because now compiling is starting
to take a while.

As always, the code is available on
[github](https://github.com/Badel2/comphdl/tree/blog-05)
. To run it:

```
git clone https://github.com/Badel2/comphdl
cd comphdl
git checkout blog-05
cargo run -- test.txt Demux_1_4
```

This will simulate the "Demux\_1\_4" component from the "test.txt" file, and
generate a "foo.vcd" file (which can be opened with gtkwave), and will print
many things to stdout, the last line beign the JSON netlist that can be pasted
to netlistsvg to generate the graphical view of the component.

See also
[appendix 1](#appendix1)
for some ideas for the future of the language.

In the next post we will go through the
code that creates the `Component`s from the parsed `CompInfo`.
// TODO: Write part 6

# <a name="appendix1"></a>Appendix 1 - Syntax improvements

Use `comp` instead of `component`.

Remove semicolons, sequence points make no sense when everything
is parallel.

Replace "->" with something shorter, for example ":", or even nothing. Also,
remove commas, spaces are enough:

```rust
comp And(a b) x {
    Nand(a b) n_x
    Nand(n_x)    x
}
```

Hmm I think that may be too minimalistic.

Is implicit variable declaration ever a good idea?

Support comments everywhere!

```rust
// Named arguments
component And3(a, b, c) -> x {
    And2(a: a, b: b) -> x: a1;
    And2(a: a1, b: c) -> x: x;
}
component Demux_2_8(s1, s0, i1, i0) -> (f01, f00, f11, f10, f21, f20, f31, f30) {
    Demux_1_4(i: i1, s1: s1, s0: s0) -> (f01, f11, f21, f31);
    Demux_1_4(i: i0, s1: s1, s0: s0) -> (f00, f10, f20, f30);
}
```

```rust
// Assignments
component Buf(d) -> q = d { }
component Buf(d => q) -> q { }
component Buf(d) -> q {
    q = d;
    q <- d;
    q <= d;
    q := d;
    d -> q;
    let d = q;
    assign d = q;
    Assign(d) -> q;
}
```

```rust
// Arrays
component And8(a[8], b[8]) -> x[8] {
    And2(a[0], b[0]) -> x[0];
    And2(a[1], b[1]) -> x[1];
    // ...
    n_x[8] = Not(x);
    (s, d, f) = n_x[3..6];
}

// Generics
component Not<N>(a[N]) -> x[N] {
    Nand(a) -> x;
}

// Var Args
component And<N, M>(*a[N][M]) -> x[N] {
    // *a expands to a[0], a[1], a[2], ...
    Nand(*a) -> n_x;
    // Not n_x
    Nand(n_x) -> x;
}
```


# <a name="appendix2"></a>Appendix 2 - LALRPOP Erorrs

What would happen if the two options could match? For example if we
allow optional parentheses arround the `Word`?

```rust
pub Outputs: Vec<String> = {
    // (a, b)
    "(" <VarArgs> ")",
    // x

LALRPOP detects an ambiguity and throws an error at us.
But not just some boring error, a fully detailed error with ASTs.

```
Local ambiguity detected

  The problem arises after having observed the following symbols in the input:
    Word "->" "(" Word
  At that point, if the next token is a `")"`, then the parser can proceed in two different ways.
First, the parser could execute the production at src/comphdl1.lalrpop:83:15: 83:25,
which would consume the
  top 1 token(s) from the stack and produce a `Comma<Word>`. This might then yield a parse tree like
    "(" Word          ╷ ")"
    │   ├─Comma<Word>─┤   │
    │   └─VarArgs─────┘   │
    └─Outputs─────────────┘

  Alternatively, the parser could shift the `")"` token and later use it to construct a `Outputs`. This might then yield a parse tree like
    Word "->" "(" Word ")"
    │         └─Outputs──┤
    └─CompCall───────────┘

  See the LALRPOP manual for advice on making your grammar LR(1).
