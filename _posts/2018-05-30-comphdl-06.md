title: Writing a digital logic simulator - Part 6
---

A modular redesign.

The files of the simulator are:

```
build.rs
Cargo.toml
src/
    main.rs
    emit_json.rs
    parser.rs
    comphdl1.lalrpop
```

We will remove most logic from the `main.rs` file, and create the following
modules:

```
src/
    main.rs
    emit_json.rs
    parser.rs
    bit.rs
    component.rs
    simulation.rs
```

Since I always forget how to do modules in Rust, you need to declare them in
the `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file:

```rust
// main.rs
mod bit;
```

And then you can either create a `bit.rs` file in the same directory, or create
a `bit/` directory and add a `bit/mod.rs` file.

Let's begin. The main function parses the command-line arguments:


```rust
fn main(){
    // Usage: cargo run (for default arguments)
    //        cargo run -- test.txt Buf123 (filename, component name)
    use std::env;
    let mut args = env::args();
    let _program_name = args.next().unwrap();
    let filename = args.next().unwrap_or(format!("test.txt"));
    let top = args.next().unwrap_or(format!("Demux_1_4"));
    parse_file(&filename, &top);
}
```

```rust
fn parse_file(filename: &str, top: &str) {
    // Create gate
    let mut gate = parser::parse_file(filename, top);

    // Run simulation
    let mut buf = Vec::with_capacity(20_000_000);
    let mut input = RepInputIterator::new(10, 50);
    run_simulation(&mut buf, &mut *gate, &mut input, 4000).unwrap();

    // Write simulation to foo.vcd
    let mut file = File::create("foo.vcd").expect("Unable to create file");
    file.write_all(&buf).expect("Error writing vcd");

    // Print netlist JSON
    yosys_netlist(&*gate);
}
```

This function should probably be named `parse_file_and_run_simulation` instead,
because there is another `parse_file` function in the `parser` module:

```rust
pub fn parse_file(filename: &str, top: &str) -> Box<Component> {
    let file = File::open(filename).expect("Unable to open file");
    let mut buf_reader = BufReader::new(file);
    let mut bs = String::new();
    buf_reader.read_to_string(&mut bs).unwrap();

    let c = comphdl1::FileParser::new().parse(&bs).unwrap();
    let s = ComponentFactory::new(c);
    let mux = s.create_named(top);
    println!("{:#?}", mux);

    mux
}
```

```rust
pub struct ComponentFactory {
    comp_id: HashMap<String, CompId>,
    components: HashMap<CompId, CompInfo>,
    comp_def: HashMap<CompId, CompDefinition>,
}
```

This is the `ComponentFactory`. 
It basically stores all the `CompInfo`: name, inputs, outputs (the output
of the parser) and also the `CompDefinition`, which stores the connections
needed to create the component.
This information is accessed using the `CompId`, which is a unique index
for each component name: for example "Nand" -> 0, "ConstantBit" -> 1.

```rust
pub struct CompId(usize);

pub struct CompInfo {
    name: String,
    inputs: Vec<String>,
    outputs: Vec<String>,
}

pub struct CompDefinition {
    comp: Vec<CompId>, // global component id, including c_zero
    connections: HashMap<ComponentIndex, Vec<ComponentIndex>>, // connections[local_comp_id][output_id]
    generics: HashMap<usize, (usize, usize)>,
}
```

`CompDefinition` stores everything that is needed to create a component: the
`CompId` of the other components needed, and the connections. There is also a
"generics" field, which is used for the `Nand` gate, since it can have any
number of inputs but we need to know that number when creating it. So if the
`Nand` with 4 inputs is the comp[2], then generics[2] will contain (4, 1).

The steps to create the `ComponentFactory` are basically:

* Create the empty hashmaps
* Insert builtin components (Nand, ConstantBit)
* Insert other components (from the parser)
* Create `CompDefinition`s for the other components

The `CompDefinition::new()` function connects the components together. That is
accomplished by using another hashmap, which maps the signal name to the
`ComponentIndex` (the component and port where it is connected). So if we do
something like:

```rust
component Buf2(a) -> a1 {
    Buf(a) -> a0;
    Buf(a0) -> a1;
}
```

Then the signals hashmap will contain two indexes in the entry for "a0":
it's the output of Buf(a), and also the input of Buf(a0). Then we just need to
verify that there is only one output connected to a0 (in this case Buf(a)), because
that's our way to avoid short-circuits.

So now we have a `ComponentFactory`, how do we create the `Component`s?

```rust
// impl ComponentFactory
fn create(&self, c_id: CompId) -> Box<Component> {
    let ref inputs = self.components[&c_id].inputs;
    let ref outputs = self.components[&c_id].outputs;
    let ref name = self.components[&c_id].name;

    println!("Creating component with id {}: {}", c_id.0, name);
    let ref def = self.comp_def[&c_id];

    let c_zero = CompIo::c_zero(inputs.len(), outputs.len());
    let mut c = vec![c_zero];
    
    for (local_id, &new_id) in def.comp.iter().enumerate().skip(1) {
        let (num_i, num_o) = def.generics[&local_id];
        let boxed_gate = if let Some(c) = self.create_builtin(new_id, num_i, num_o) {
            println!("DEBUG: Created builtin gate {}", self.components[&new_id].name);
            c
        } else {
            self.create(new_id)
        };
        let mut x = CompIo::new(boxed_gate);
        c.push(x);
    }

    for (from, to) in &def.connections {
        let ref mut x = c[from.c_id];
        assert!(from.is_output());
        for ref to in to {
            assert!(!to.is_output());
            x.add_connection(from.port_id, Index::new(to.c_id, to.port_id));
        }
    }

    let pn = PortNames::new_vec(inputs.clone(), outputs.clone());
    let gate = Structural::new(c, inputs.len(), outputs.len(), &self.components[&c_id].name, pn);

    Box::new(gate)
}
```

The process is similar to what we used to do manually: create the components
and add connections, but now we have everything stored so the process is
simple. We use recursion to create the inner components, except when the inner
component is a builtin (like a Nand). Then we add the connections, the port
names, and finally create the `Structural` and return the boxed component. We
could probably return a `Structural` instead of a `Box<Component>`, since the
other components like the Nand can be trivially converted into a `Structural`:

```rust
component Nand4(a, b, c, d) -> x {
    Nand(a, b, c, d) -> x;
}
```

Oh yeah, that's a problem, since the `emit_json.rs` code only works on
`Structural`, because `Component`s don't necessarily have any connections.  As
a reminder, `Component` is a trait and `Structural` implements that trait,
`Nand` and `ConstantBit` also implement it. We can't downcast the `Component`
to `Structural`, because it may be a `Nand` instead, so a nice hack is to add
this method to the `Component` trait:

```rust 
// trait Component
fn clone_as_structural(&self) -> Option<Structural> {
    None
}
```

Leave that default implementation for `Nand` and other components, but
implement it for `Structural`:

```rust 
// impl Component for Structural
fn clone_as_structural(&self) -> Option<Structural> {
    Some(self.clone())
}
```

But to clone a `Structural` we need to be able to clone `Component`s, since
a `Structural` owns many `Box<Component>`. There is another hack to allow this:

```rust 
trait Component {
    fn box_clone(&self) -> Box<Component>;
}

impl Clone for Box<Component> {
    fn clone(&self) -> Box<Component> {
        self.box_clone()
    }
}

impl Component for Nand {
    fn box_clone(&self) -> Box<Component> {
        Box::new((*self).clone())
    }
}
```

We manually implement `Clone` for a boxed component, which relies on the
`box_clone` method, which can be easily implemented just by copy-pasting that
one line of code.

For future reference, if you ever find yourself doing stuff like that, then
your code is horribly wrong. In my case I will try to fix that in the future.

Now that we introduced the `ComponentFactory`, that should be a main
feature, so let's rebuild the simulator arround it. Let's begin with the
components. Right now every instance of every component stores its name
and its port names, but that isn't necesary, we could store that data in
a common list. Such a list already exists, it's the `components` field in
the `ComponentFactory`. Actually, we don't even need to store the connections
since they also are common. We can just store a reference to the definition of
this component. That would leave the `Structural` as just:

```rust
struct Structural {
    signals: Vec<CompIo>, // components and state
    info: Rc<CompInfo>, // name and port names
    connections: Rc<CompDefinition>, // components and connections
}
struct CompIo {
    comp: Box<Component>,
    input: Vec<Bit>,
    output: Vec<Bit>,
}
```

We can use reference counting pointers `Rc` to store references in a safe way.
Another option would be to store the `CompId` and a reference to the
`ComponentFactory`, and get info and connections from there (but how do we get
a `Rc<ComponentFactory>` in the `create()` method?). Either way I think that we
should separate code from data. So let's do the first option, we need
`Rc<CompInfo>` and `Rc<CompDefinition>` so we must change the
`ComponentFactory` definition to:

```rust
pub struct ComponentFactory {
    comp_id: HashMap<String, CompId>,
    components: HashMap<CompId, Rc<CompInfo>>,
    comp_def: HashMap<CompId, Rc<CompDefinition>>,
}
```

Luckly we can transform a `HashMap<K, V>` into a `HashMap<K, Rc<V>>` using
a one-liner:

```rust
let components = components.into_iter().map(|(k, v)| (k, Rc::new(v))).collect();
let comp_def = comp_def.into_iter().map(|(k, v)| (k, Rc::new(v))).collect();
```

And magically the code compiles.

To change the `Structural` we need to do many things, but there is a small
problem with the connections. `Rc<CompDefinition>` stores the connections as a
HashMap, so we cannot iterate over all the connections of a component. Well, we
can but it won't be as efficient as a vector. So for now let's just store the
connections as a `Vec` instead of using a `Rc`. This will allow a small optimization:

```rust
fn propagate(&mut self, c_id: usize) {
    // TODO: avoid this clone
    let connections = self.components[c_id].connections.clone();
    for (out_id, to) in connections.iter().enumerate() {
        for i in to {
            self.components[i.comp_id]
                .input[i.input_id] = self.components[c_id].output[out_id];
        }
    }
}
```

Here we want to modify `self.components` to propagate the signal. Since the
connections are also stored in `self.components`, Rust doesn't allow us to
iterate over something that may be destroyed. So we are forced to clone the
connections, which is relatively expensive. But if we store the connections
in `Structural` instead, this problem disappears:

```rust
    let connections = &self.connections[c_id];
```

This is important, because if you think about it, `CompIo` is a component's
interface, so it must know the connections, but the connections are represented
as indexes which can only be used by the `Structural`, so it makes more sense
to store them independently.

While we are at it, let's add another simple optimization. Currently, we update
everything every time. But most of the time, if one component's input doesn't
change, the output will also not change. So let's add a new method to the
`Component` trait:

```rust
// trait Component
// Does this component need an update even if the inputs haven't changed?
fn needs_update(&self) -> bool {
    true
}
```

The default is that a component will always be updated, and we must opt-in to
this optimization.

```rust
// Nand
fn needs_update(&self) -> bool {
    false // The output depends only on the inputs
}
// ConstantBit
fn needs_update(&self) -> bool {
    // This component has no inputs, so it should only be updated once
    false
}
// Structural
fn needs_update(&self) -> bool {
    // a structural needs an update if any of its components does
    self.component_dirty.iter().skip(1).any(|&x| x == true)
}
```

Our builtin components, the Nand and the ConstantBit don't have any state, so
they only need to be updated when their inputs change (in the case of the
ConstantBit which doesn't have any inputs, they never change so it will never
be updated, which is what we want).

The `Structural` is a bit more complicated because we need to keep track of
which internal signals change, because that will trigger an update. We store
the internal components which need an update as `component_dirty: Vec<bool>`.
I'm not sure if "dirty" is the right term, but that's what is used in graphics:
when you resize a window it must be redrawn so it is marked as dirty. A quick
google search shows that this may be a correct term, as it's used to refer to
[dirty bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_bit)
. So how do we mark components as dirty? Easy, just change a bit the
`update_components` function:

```rust
fn update_components(&mut self) {
    for c in 1..self.components.len() {
        // Iterate over dirty components only
        if self.component_dirty[c] == false {
            continue;
        }
        self.components[c].update();
        self.component_dirty[c] = self.components[c].comp.needs_update();
    }
}
```

If a component is dirty, update it and ask if it need to be updated again. But
we also need to force an update when the inputs change, so now we need to modify
the `propagate` function again:

```rust
fn propagate(&mut self, c_id: usize) {
    let connections = &self.connections[c_id];
    for (out_id, to) in connections.iter().enumerate() {
        for i in to {
            if self.components[i.comp_id]
                .input[i.input_id] != self.components[c_id].output[out_id] {

                self.components[i.comp_id]
                    .input[i.input_id] = self.components[c_id].output[out_id];
                self.component_dirty[i.comp_id] = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

It may be a bit hard to see, but it's basically:

```rust
// Before:
a = b;

// Now
if a != b {
    a = b;
    dirty = true;
}
```

There is also a small addition to `CompIo`, now it stores if the output has
changed in the last update. That's very useful because if the output doesn't
change we can skip propagating the signals for this component. So we add a
`output_changed: bool` flag, and create the update function:

```rust
pub fn update(&mut self) {
    let new_output = self.comp.update(&self.input);
    if new_output == self.output {
        self.output_changed = false;
    } else {
        self.output = new_output;
        self.output_changed = true;
    }
}
```

Nice optimizations, let's do some benchmarks. We are only interested in the
simulation time, but let's just make it very long, that should be enough. I run
a simulation for 4 million ticks, which would generate about 1 GB of data in
vcd format so it's important to not save it.

Thanks to the magic of version control we can go back in time.
