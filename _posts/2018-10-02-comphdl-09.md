While browsing through
[code golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com)
I realized that it would be nice if I could solve some of the
challenges using comphdl, if you can call that a programming language.
However, most of the challenges require to read an input and return
an output, so I would need an easy way to enter the input.

After considering many alternatives, I just decided to add two new
dedicated components: `Stdin` and `Stdout`.

# Stdin

The definition of the `Stdin` component is like the following:

```rust
component Stdin(clk) -> (EOF, x[7:0]) {}
```

This component reads one byte from the standard input. When running from the
terminal, stdin is well defined, but in the Web demo there is no stdin. For now
we will just ignore the web.

* `clk` is the clock signal. I have not covered the theory behind this yet, but
we need a way to ask the component for an update. This is accomplished by
updating the component when the `clk` signal changes from `0` to `1` (on
rising edge of `clk`). In this case, updating the component means reading one
byte from stdin.

* `EOF` is the end of file flag. We need a way to tell when the input stream
has ended. An alternative would be setting all the bits to `0` to represent
EOF, but then it would be impossible to read a literal `0`.

* `x[7:0]` is the input byte. Before the first rising edge of `clk` it is set
to `X`, same as when on `EOF`.

# Stdout

The `Stdout` component is used to write bytes to the standard output.

```rust
component Stdout(clk, x[7:0]) {}
```

It is similar to the `Stdin` component: it writes the byte on rising edge of
`clk`. But it does not have a `EOF` flag, or any flag indicating write error,
so that any potential programs can assume that writing to `Stdout` will always
succeed.

# Testing

Since these components don't work in the web demo, we must get back to the old
way of testing: GTKWave. It looks like the command-line version of the
simulator still works fine, so let's see if the `Stdin` component works as
expected.

```rust
component Top(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]) {
    Stdin(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);
}
```

The input can be entered into the terminal just fine, but I have added the
option to read the input from a file named "stdin.txt", to simplify things.
GTKWave supports many different ways to represent the signals, one of
them is "ASCII", so hopefully we will be able to see the output just fine:

Helo, world! Nice, it works! 

# Wasm

As I mentioned earlier, the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Rust target does not
support stdin or stdout, so these components will not work on the web demo.

But we can emulate stdin and stdout by using HTML textareas.

Then, we just have to modify the code to accept an arbitrary IO stream instead
of the hardcoded stdin/stdout. It turns out that is not as trivial as it
sounds. The problem is that most of the code assumes that a `Component` can be
cloned.

And how do we clone an IO stream? A trivial workaround is to use a `Rc<T>`, a
reference counted pointer. This would allow multiple components to own the
same IO stream. Then we can combine it with a `RefCell<T>`, which allows to
perform mutable operations on inmutable references. The result is the
`Rc<RefCell<T>>` pattern, which is used to perform runtime borrow checking
[(what?)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html)
.
We define these wrapper types, the `BufRead` trait is used to represent an
input stream, and `Write` is used to represent an output stream.

```rust
pub struct RcBufRead(pub Rc<RefCell<BufRead>>);
pub struct RcWrite(pub Rc<RefCell<Write>>);
```

But in each case we must manually check if it is safe to access the IO stream.
For example, what would happen if two components which use the same input
stream get updated at once? The input would be read twice, resulting in skipped
bytes. Now that I think about it, that problem could be avoided by keeping a
buffer with the input and then returning bytes from that buffer instead of
stdin. But the point is that I do not want to allow multiple `Stdin` or
`Stdout` components, only 1 per simulation.

We could also add support for multiple IO streams: reading and writing from
files (or more textareas), but then how do we define which stream corresponds
to which component? We would need some syntax to specify the stream, maybe an
id would be enough, something like:

```rust
Stdin<0>(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);
Stdin<1>(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);
Stdin<"test.txt">(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);

#[filename = "test.txt"]
Stdin(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);
```

While trying to figure out the best solution, I decided to just try the
`Rc<RefCell<T>>` pattern and implement the textarea-based input streams
without adding any new syntax.

# Cat

Now that we have these two components, we can start by implementing one of the
simplest unix commands: `cat`. Essentially, it pipes stdin to stdout:

```rust
component Cat(clk) -> eof {
    Stdin(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);
    Stdout(clk, x[7:0]);
}
```

After manually clicking `clk` for a while, we get the following output:

![Stdin and stdout](https://imgur.com/fjHwWnh.png)

(I didn't want to take a screenshot, but it is impossible to copy-paste strings
which contain null bytes, and it looks like jekyll doesn't support them either.
I can reproduce the output using javascript, so you can try to copy-paste the
entire string. Interesingly, copying just a part of the string works fine.)

<input id="nullbytes" size="25">

<script type="text/javascript">
document.getElementById("nullbytes").value = "\u00000123456789ABCDEF\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000";
</script>

But the point is that we get null bytes in the output, why? Well, we can use
step-by-step execution to find out, but as always the problem resides in the
simulation model. `Stdin` and `Stdout` are connected to the same clock signal,
but `Stdout` requires the input of `Stdin` which will be available one tick
after updating `Stdin`.  Otherwise, `Stdout` tries to write the uninitialized
`x`, which is converted to `0` because we cannot write an `X` into a binary
stream.  So we can fix the null byte from the beginning by adding a `Buf`
before feeding `clk` to `Stdout`:

```rust
component Cat(clk) -> eof {
    Stdin(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);
    Stdout(clk2, x[7:0]);
    Buf(clk) -> clk2;
}
component Buf(a) -> x {
    x = a;
}
```

But this still has the problem of the null bytes after the input has ended.
This is where the `eof` signal comes handy. We want to stop outputting bytes
when `eof` is true, so `clk2 = clk and !eof`. Rewriting that in terms of NAND
gates is simple, but adds a delay. We must add the same delay to the data
signals to prevent data loss, the result is the final `Cat` implementation:

```rust
component Cat(enable) -> (eof3) {
    Clk2(enable) -> clk;
    Stdin(clk) -> (eof, x[7:0]);
    Buf(eof) -> eof1;
    Buf(eof1) -> eof2;
    Buf(eof2) -> eof3;
    Nand(eof) -> neof;
    Buf(clk) -> bclk1;
    Buf(bclk1) -> bclk;
    Nand(neof, bclk) -> nclk2;
    Nand(nclk2) -> clk2;
    Bufw8(x[7:0]) -> x1[7:0];
    Bufw8(x1[7:0]) -> x2[7:0];
    Bufw8(x2[7:0]) -> x3[7:0];
    Stdout(clk2, x3[7:0]);
}

component Buf(a) -> x {
    a = x;
}

component Bufw8(a[7:0]) -> x[7:0] {
    Buf(a[0]) -> x[0];
    Buf(a[1]) -> x[1];
    Buf(a[2]) -> x[2];
    Buf(a[3]) -> x[3];
    Buf(a[4]) -> x[4];
    Buf(a[5]) -> x[5];
    Buf(a[6]) -> x[6];
    Buf(a[7]) -> x[7];
}

component Clk2(a) -> x {
    Nand(a, x) -> x;
}
```

We also use a trick to replace `clk` with `enable`, this way we do not need to
press `clk` twice to see a single byte. The `Clk2` component generates a clock
signal with period = 2 (1 tick up, 1 tick down), which is the fastest clock
possible in this simulator. It exploits the fact that a `Nand` with the output
connected to its own input will toggle its state on every update.

# HtmlComponents

It would be nice to have more components which the user can interact with.
I have some ideas:

* A numerical input
* A 7-segment display
* LEDs and switches
* A monochrome screen
* A terminal

The exact design remains a question, but for now I can implement the terminal,
I just have to connect it to the "stdin" and "stdout" textareas.
I found a nice terminal, [xtermjs](https://xtermjs.org/), which is supposed to
support ANSI escape codes, and even ncurses. The installation was fairly
simple, I just copied the bundled files into the `static/xtermjs/` directory,
as I am not using `npm` for this project yet.

Here you can see the terminal running the `Cat` program with its own source
code as input.

![xtermjs newline fail](https://imgur.com/gM1iG1d.png)

See anything weird? It looks like a newline `\n` is interpreted in the MS-DOS
way: the next line starts at the position where the previous line ends. The
terminal expects newlines in the format `\r\n`. The fix is to replace `\n` by
`\r\n`, but that makes me wonder if there are more problems like this that I
have not noticed yet.

To try the terminal, run the `Cat` program and enable the `enable` input.
There should be a button somewhere to open the terminal called "COMPONENT
STDOUT". You must click on the terminal and then just start writing. You should
be able to see the bytes flowing trought the component below, and then appear
on the terminal. The ANSI escape codes work fine, you can test it by pressing
`ESC [ H` which will move the cursor to home (the top left corner). Colors are
also supported, you can find all the escape codes
[here](http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php)
.

# Logging

After managing to add a terminal to the web demo, I thought that it would be a
nice replacement to the `console.log()` logging. In Rust it's pretty standard
to use the [log crate](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/log) which defines
useful macros for each log level: 

```rust
trace!
info!
debug!
warn!
error!
```

And the best part is that the user can control where to write the logs! So if I
replace all the `println!` I used for debugging with actual debugging messages,
and add the [env-logger](https://github.com/sebasmagri/env_logger) crate for the
terminal version, enabling log messages will be as simple as:

```sh
RUST_LOG=info cargo run 
```

To my surprise there was no easy way to integrate `env-logger` with
`console.log`, in the end I just copied some code from the
[pretty-env-logger](https://github.com/seanmonstar/pretty-env-logger)
crate, combined it with the
[stdweb-logger](https://github.com/hobofan/stdweb_logger) crate, and replaced
`console.log` with `term2.writeln`. Praise open source! The resulting code
can be found at
[src/stdweb\_logger.rs](https://github.com/Badel2/comphdl/blob/a1384787c1e05a020538540f199e837b7f5aa5ff/src/stdweb_logger.rs)
, and this is how it looks like:

# Conclusion

Now that we have stdin and stdout, we can begin to write a comphdl parser in
comphdl! One step closer to self-hosting!

I said I wanted to support more "interactive" components. This would require a
redesign of the web demo, as things are becoming messy, there is hardly enough
space for a terminal.

As always, the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Badel2/comphdl/tree/blog-09)
